{"Title":"Belt Renderer","Text":"<size=16><b>Belt Renderer</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <b>Belt Renderer</b> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then in the menus go to <i>Standard Components > Belt System > Belt Renderer</i>.\r\n\r\nA Belt Renderer is used to generate a <i>circumference spline</i> for the Loft Mesh of the <b>Belt System</b>. It requires at least two <b>Belt Rolls</b> to be able to generate a Spline. Make sure the <b>Wheel Joints</b> used in the Belt Rolls share the same <b>Axis Direction</b> and that the <b>planes</b> of the Wheel Joints are an <b>exact match</b>. Otherwise the Belt Render is unable to generate a Spline.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have assigned all required Belt Rolls, a spline should automatically be generated around all assigned Belt Rolls' Wheel Joints, in the order that they have been added to the list. If you would move the Belt Rolls, the spline will instantly be updated with it. The spline is generated on a new GameObject as a child of the Belt Renderer.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/281052387/Belt+Renderer","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
