{"Title":"Belt System","Text":"<size=16><b>Belt System</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <b>Belt System</b> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then in the menus go to <i>Standard Components > Belt System > Add Physical Component</i>.\r\n\r\nA Belt System is used to generate a <b>Loft Mesh</b> and transport objects over its surface using the rotation of a <b>Wheel Joint</b>.\r\n\r\nA Loft Mesh needs to be <i>generated</i> before the Belt System is able to transport objects. A Loft Mesh requires two <b>Splines</b> to describe its shape; a circumference spline describing the shape of its circumference, and a surface spline to describe the shape of its surface. \r\n\r\nTo create a circumference spline for the Belt System, we recommend using the <b>Belt Renderer</b>.\r\nTo create a surface spline, add a new <b>Spline</b> to the scene by browsing the menus to <i>Utilities > Create > Spline</i>. Then position the newly created spline <b>on and perpendicular</b> to the circumference spline. \r\n\r\nTo generate the Loft Mesh, assign both splines to the Belt System and click <i>Generate Surface</i>. This may take a few seconds depending on your workstation.\r\nAs soon as a surface has been generated, click <i>Generate Loft Mesh</i>. Again, this may take a few seconds.\r\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>: Do not delete the splines after generating the Loft Mesh since these are still used by the Belt System.\r\n\r\nIf objects eventually fall through the top surface of the Loft Mesh but remain on the bottom surface, enable <b>Invert Surface Normals</b> and click <i>Generate Loft Mesh</i> again. \r\n\r\nTo transport objects over the generated Loft Mesh, assign a <b>Wheel Joint</b> to the Belt System. Rotating the Wheel Joint results in a velocity on the Belt System with which it will transport objects over its surface. If the Wheel Joint rotates in the opposite direct of which objects are transported, enable <b>Invert Axis</b> on the Belt System.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280953719/Belt+System","SubComponents":"Belt Renderer;Belt Roll;Spline","Locked":true}
