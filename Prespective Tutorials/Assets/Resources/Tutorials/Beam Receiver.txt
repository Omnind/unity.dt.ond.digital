A Beam Receiver fires two events:\r\n- <b>OnSignalHigh</b>: Fired as soon as the receiver <b>detects</b> a beam.\r\n- <b>OnSignalLow</b>: Fired as soon as the receiver <b>loses</b> detection of a beam.\r\n\r\nIn order for a Beam Receiver to function, it must have a <b>Collider</b> for the beam the collide with.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280954035/Receiver","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
