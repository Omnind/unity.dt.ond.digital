{"Title":"Belt Roll","Text":"<size=16><b>Belt Roll</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <b>Belt Roll</b> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then in the menus go to <i>Standard Components > Belt System > Belt Roll</i>.\r\n\r\nA Belt Roll is used as a part of a <b>Belt Renderer</b> for generating a Spline.\r\nA Belt Roll requires a <b>Wheel Joint</b>. If no Wheel Joint is present when you create the Belt Roll, a new Wheel Joint will be created on the same GameObject.\r\n\r\nThe Belt Roll allows you to change the Wheel Joint's <b>radius</b>, causing the Belt Redenderer to <i>update</i> its spline. If you change the radius from the Wheel Joint itself, the Spline will <i>not</i> be updated.\r\nBy clicking <i>Flip Belt Direction</i> you will change the direction of the Belt Roll in the system, allowing you to have the spline be drawn around the Wheel Joint CW or CCW.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280988236/Belt+Roll","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
