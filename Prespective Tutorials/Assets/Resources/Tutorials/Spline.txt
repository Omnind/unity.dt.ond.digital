{"Title":"Spline","Text":"<size=16><b>Spline</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo create a <b>Spline</b>, go to <i>Utilities > Create > Spline</i>. This will generate a new spline. \r\n\r\nSplines will be generated with two controll points by default, but you can add as many as you need.\r\n\r\nEach controll point has a <b>Handle Type</b> which determines how the controll point will affect the spline going in and out from the controll point.\r\n\r\nOn the Spline GameObject itself you can check <b>Close Spline</b> to make the spline a closed loop. The last point will then automatically be connected to the first.\r\n\r\n<b>TIP:</b> For easy positioning of the control points, press and hold <i>V</i> while positioning, to make the control point snap to mesh vertices.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280985937/Spline","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
