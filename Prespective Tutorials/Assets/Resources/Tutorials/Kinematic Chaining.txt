{"Title":"Kinematic Chaining","Text":"<size=16><b>Kinematic Chaining</b></size>\r\n\r\nA Kinematic Chain is needed for <b>multiple</b> Kinematic transforms (i.e. <i>WheelJoint</i> or <i>Prismatic Joint</i>) to <b>cooperate</b>.\r\n\r\nTo create a Kinematic Chain between Kinematic Transforms, open the inspector a Kinematic Transform. Under <i>Kinematic Chaining</i> click the button <b>Create New Leading Transform Relation</b>. This creates a new entry which you can unfold to reveal a few options. Here you can select another Kinematic Transform to which you want to link the current one to.\r\n\r\nIn this menu you can change the <b>translation direction</b>, which defaults to Bidirectional. You can also select to either manage <b>translation or rotation</b>. Lastly you can set the <b>motion</b> to be <b>reversed</b>.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, note that the <b>radius</b> of a WheelJoint directly affects the translation factor between it and another Kinematic Transform.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280987195/Add+Kinematics","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
