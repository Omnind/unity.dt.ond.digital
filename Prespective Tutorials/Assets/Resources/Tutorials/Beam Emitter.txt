{"Title":"Beam Emitter","Text":"<size=16><b>Beam Emitter</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <b>Beam Emitter</b> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then go to <i>Standard Components > Beam Sensor > Emitter > Add Physical Component</i>.\r\n\r\nA Beam Emitter only functions in <b>Play Mode</b>. \\nUnder the tab <i>Live Data</i> tab you can read the live data of the component. Here you can see whether it is currently activated and whether it has reached its Redirection Limit.\r\n\r\nIn the <i>properties</i> tab you can control how the beam will be emitted. You can set its <b>point of origin</b> and its <b>direction</b>. Also you can set the maximum <b>distance</b> the laser can travel and the maximum number of <b>allowed redirections</b>. \r\n\r\nBy default the beam will be projected through a <i>Gizmo</i>. If you select a <b>beam material</b>, the beam will be projected by a generated mesh with that material. The beam <b>radius</b> controls the thickness of the mesh.\r\n\r\nTo be able to control the component, create a <b>Control Panel</b> for the component.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280986794/Emitter","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
