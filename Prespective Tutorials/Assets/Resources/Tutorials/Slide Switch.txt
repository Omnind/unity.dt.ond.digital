{"Title":"Slide Switch","Text":"<size=16><b>Slide Switch</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <b>Slide Switch</b> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then go to <i>Standard Componenets > Slide Switch > Add Physical Component</i>.\r\n\r\nIn the <i>Live Data</i> tab you can see the <b>selected state</b> of the switch along with its ID. This, however, only works in Play Mode.\r\n\r\nIn the <i>properties</i> tab you first need to assign a <b>Prismatic Joint</b>. This is necessary for the Slide Switch to function. \r\n\r\nTo add Switch States, position the game object to the preferred position and click <b>Save current position as state</b>. This will generate a new entry in the <b>Switch States List</b> where you can give the state a name and change its value if needed. The upper and lower weight of a state determines where the transition between two states occur; the higher the weight, the further the point of transition lies from the state.\r\n\r\nEvery <i>Switch State</i> has two events it fires. \r\n- The <b>OnSelected</b> event fires as soon as that state gets selected.\r\n- The <b>OnUnselected</b> event fires as soon as that state is no longer selected. \r\n\r\nFor the <i>Slide Switch</i> to actually function, assign at least two different <i>Switch States</i>!\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280855910/Slide+Switch","SubComponents":"Spline","Locked":true}
