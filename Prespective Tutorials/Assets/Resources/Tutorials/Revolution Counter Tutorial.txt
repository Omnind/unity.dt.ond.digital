{"Title":"Revolution Counter Tutorial","Text":"<size=16><b>Revolution Counter Tutorial</b></size>\n\nThis is a Prespective beginners tutorial. It will teach you the basics of working with Prespective.\n\nIn this tutorial you will need to rig the revolution counter by having a DC motor rotate the wheel. The Beam Emitter should be emitting a Beam which will reach the Beam Receiver as soon as the gap in the wheel is rotated in front of the Beam Emitter.\n\n<i>In order to complete this tutorial you will need to:</i>\n\n- Create a <b>Kinematics Controller</b>\n\n- Add a <b>WheelJoint</b> to the Axis object.\n\n- Add a <b>DCMotor</b> to the Motor object.\n\n- Add a <b>BeamEmitter</b> to the Emitter Lens object.\n\n- Add an <b>BeamReceiver</b> to the Receiver Eye object.\n\n- Have the BeamReceiver <b>increment the Count value</b> of the RevolutionCounter script on the Revolution Counter object every time its output signal switches to High.","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/280987556/Basic+Tutorial+-+Revolution+Counter","SubComponents":"Kinematics Controller;Wheel Joint;DC Motor;Beam Emitter;Beam Receiver","Locked":true}
