{"Title":"3D Printer Tutorial - Organize","Text":"<size=16><b>3D Printer Tutorial</b></size>\r\n\r\nThis is a Prespective Project tutorial. It will teach you working with Prespective.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial you will need to rig a 3D printer with a kinematic setup and have it be controlled through an external controller (Twincat PLC).\r\n\r\n<i>In order to complete this tutorial you will need to:</i>\r\n\r\n- Fix the <b>pivot</b> of the parent of the gear object <b>marked red</b>. It is missaligned and needs to be fixed using the Alignment Tool and the Pivot Tool. <b>TIP:</b> Create a new empty GameObject and align it to the gear. Then use it to set the new pivot of the gear.\r\n\r\n- Organize the model into groups using the <b>Grouping Tool</b>. We recommend creating a group for the <i>Frame</i>, the <i>Support Objects</i> and the <i>Functional Objects</i>.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/overview","SubComponents":"Alignment Tool;Pivot Tool;Grouping Tool","Locked":true}
