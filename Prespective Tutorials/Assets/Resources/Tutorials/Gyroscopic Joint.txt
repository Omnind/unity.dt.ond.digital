{"Title":"Gyroscopic Joint","Text":"<size=16><b>Gyroscopic Joint</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <i>Gyroscopic Joint</i> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then in the menus go to <i>Mechanics -> Add Kinematics -> Gyroscopic Joint</i>.\r\n\r\nA Gyroscopic Joint will try to have a specified direction to be constant.\r\nTo specify the constant direction, set a direction under <b>Global Up Direction</b>.\r\n\r\nIf setup correctly, the specified direction should now remain constant, independant of how the object is orientated in the world.\r\n\r\nFor a Gyroscopic Joint to function, it needs to be parented under a <b>Kinematics Controller</b>. Make sure to check <b>Enforce outside playmode</b> to ensure that it will function properly in Edit Mode.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/281673832/Gyroscopic+Joint","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
