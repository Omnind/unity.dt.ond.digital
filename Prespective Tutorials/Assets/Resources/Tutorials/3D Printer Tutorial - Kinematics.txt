{"Title":"3D Printer Tutorial - Kinematics","Text":"<size=16><b>3D Printer Tutorial</b></size>\r\n\r\nThis is a Prespective Project tutorial. It will teach you working with Prespective.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial you will need to rig a 3D printer with a kinematic setup and have it be controlled through an external controller (Twincat PLC).\r\n\r\nBefore you can complete these steps, make sure you have completed organizing the model.\r\n\r\n<i>In order to complete this tutorial you will need to:</i>\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematics Controller</b>.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>WheelJoint</b> on all gears. These include the motor gears, the worm drive and the belt gears. \r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between all the gears so that they rotate together as intended.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> on the plateau (Z Axis)\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between the Prismatic Joint on the plateau and the Wheel Joint on the worm drive. Adjust the Wheel Joint <b>radius</b> for a perfect translation.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> on Carrier Rod of the Printer Head for the X Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> on Carrier Rod of the Printer Head for the Y Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between the gears of the X motor and the Carrier Rod for the X Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between the gears of the Y motor and the Carrier Rod for the Y Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a GameObject under the <b>same parent</b> as the Printer Head. Parent the Printer Head <b>under</b> this new GameObject. Create a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> on the new GameObject for the X Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a GameObject under the <b>same parent</b> as the Printer Head. Parent the Printer Head <b>under</b> this new GameObject. Create a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> on the new GameObject for the Y Axis.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between the Carrier Rod for the X Axis and the X Axis parent of the Printer head.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Kinematic Relation</b> between the Carrier Rod for the Y Axis and the Y Axis parent of the Printer head.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Driven Stepper Motor</b> on each of the motor GameObjects. Remove the automatically created Wheel Joints and assign the previously create Wheel Joints to the Driven Stepper Motors.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/overview","SubComponents":"Kinematics Controller;Wheel Joint;Prismatic Joint;Kinematic Chaining;Driven Stepper Motor;Control Panel","Locked":true}
