{"Title":"3D Printer Tutorial - Logic","Text":"<size=16><b>3D Printer Tutorial</b></size>\r\n\r\nThis is a Prespective Project tutorial. It will teach you working with Prespective.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial you will need to rig a 3D printer with a kinematic setup and have it be controlled through an external controller (Twincat PLC).\r\n\r\nBefore you can complete these steps, make sure you have completed organizing the model and that you have completed the kinematic setup.\r\n\r\n<i>In order to complete this tutorial you will need to:</i>\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Logic Simulator</b> and set the proper settings.\r\n\r\n- Create a <b>Logic Component</b> for each of the Driven Stepper Motors and set the proper settings.\r\n\r\n- Finalize the settings for the Logic Simulator and the PLC project.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/overview","SubComponents":"Logic Simulator (TWINCAT_ADS);Logic Component","Locked":true}
