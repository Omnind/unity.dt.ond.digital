{"Title":"Alignment Tool","Text":"<size=16><b>Alignment Tool</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo align two GameObjects you will need to use the alignment tool. You can find this under <i>Utilities > Alignment Tool</i>. \r\n\r\nThis will open a new window. \r\nHere you can select the two GameObjects you want to align. Keep in mind that <b>Part A</b> will move onto <b>Part B</b>. \r\nOnce you select a GameObject, it will have <i>3-Point Plane</i> preselected as tool type. You can change this to various different tools to fit your needs. \r\nThe tool will draw a (teal by default) alignment direction line. The two direction lines will align to each other as soon as you click <b>Apply Alignment</b>.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/281051436/Alignment+Tool","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
