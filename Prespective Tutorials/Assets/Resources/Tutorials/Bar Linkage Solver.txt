{"Title":"Bar Linkage Solver","Text":"<size=16><b>Bar Linkage Solver</b></size>\r\n\r\nTo add a <i>Bar Linkage Solver</i> to a GameObject, select the GameObject you want to asign it to in the hierarchy. Then in the menus go to <i>Mechanics -> Add Kinematics -> Bar Linkage Solver</i>.\r\n\r\nA Bar Linkage Solver in essence is a <b>Prismatic Joint</b> with extra functionality. The Bar Linkage Solver is firstly setup in the same way as a Prismatic Joint.\r\n\r\nTo create a <b>Triangle</b>, in for example a Piston setup, you will need to assign two seperate Wheel Joints in a Triangle. Click <b>Add Triangle</b>. Unfold the newly created Triangle and assign one WheelJoint as <b>FixPivot</b> and the other as <b>HingePoint</b>.\r\nThe parenting object of the Bar Linkage Solver should have a WheelJoint and be set as the FixPivot. The other WheelJoint in the Triangle is the HingePoint.\r\nMake sure the axes of both WheelJoints are similar, otherwise the Bar Linkage Solver cannot function properly.\r\n\r\nFor a <i>Bar Linkage Solver</i> to function, it needs to be parented under a Kinematics Controller. Make sure to check <b>Enforce outside playmode</b> to ensure that it will function properly in Edit Mode. All assigned WheelJoint need to have Enforce Outside Playmode enabled also.\r\n\r\nAs soon as everything has been setup, you should be able to move the Bar Linkage Solver and the Triangle(s) should move along with it.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/281673984/Bar+Linkage+Solver","SubComponents":"","Locked":true}
