Then go to <i>Mechanics > Add Kinematics > Prismatic Joint</i>.\r\n\r\nOn this component you can find many settings to adjust the Prismatic Joint to your  needs.\r\n\r\nFor a PrismaticJoint to function, it needs to be parented under a <b>Kinematics Controller</b>. Make sure to check <b>Enforce outside playmode</b> to ensure that it will function properly in Edit Mode. \r\nPrismatic Joints always needs a <b>Spline</b> to be able to function. You can asign one by dragging a spline in under <b>Limit Rotations & Update Settings</b>.\r\n\r\nYou can crop a spline to align it exactly to the model by dragging your GameObject in the position you want to set a limit. Then select the controll point you want to set that limit at and click <b>Update limit controll point</b>.\r","DocumentationURL":"https://unit040.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUD/pages/281051887/Prismatic+Joint","SubComponents":"Spline","Locked":true}
